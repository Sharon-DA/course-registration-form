## 📚 What I Learned

I learned how to use React to build a form and manage input values with `useState`.
I also practiced adding validation rules, showing error messages when inputs are wrong, and displaying a success message when the form is filled in properly.
This helped me understand how to handle forms in React in a clear and user-friendly way.

Additionally, I gained experience with:
- Modern CSS styling with gradients and animations
- Form validation patterns and error handling
- Component structure and state management
- Professional UI/UX design principles
- Responsive web design techniques
